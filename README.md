Final Project of JavaScript Course
Description
This is the final project of the JavaScript Course. In this project, NFTs have been implemented using JavaScript.

Tasks Completed
The following tasks have been implemented in this challenge:

Create a variable to hold NFTs:

We declared a variable that can store multiple NFTs. This is an array that will hold our NFT objects.
Create an object inside the mintNFT function:

The mintNFT function creates an object to hold the metadata for each NFT. The metadata values are passed to the function as parameters. Once the NFT is created, it is stored in the variable created in Step 1.
Print all NFTs' metadata:

The listNFTs function prints the metadata of all the NFTs to the console. This includes the name, skin color, hair color, and shoe type of each NFT.
Return the number of NFTs created:

The getTotalSupply function returns the total number of NFTs we have created.
