# Final Project of JavaScript Course

## Description
This is the final project of the JavaScript Course. In this project, NFT has been implemented using JavaScript.

## Tasks Completed
The following tasks have been implemented in this challenge:
   1. Variable to Hold NFTs:A variable has been created to store multiple NFTs. This variable is an array that will contain all the NFT objects.
   2. Minting NFTs:The mintNFT function is designed to create an NFT object that holds metadata. The metadata values (name, skin color, hair color, shoe type) are passed as parameters to this function. The created NFT object is then stored in the array defined in Step 1.
   3. Listing NFTs:The listNFTs function prints the metadata of all NFTs to the console. This includes logging the name, skin color, hair color, and shoe type of each NFT.
   4. Total Supply of NFTs:The getTotalSupply function returns the total number of NFTs created by outputting the length of the array containing the NFTs.


      
## How to Run the Project
To run the project, follow the instructions below:
   1. Clone the repository:Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
      sh
      git clone <link of repo>


   2. Set up the project environment:Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from nodejs.org.

   3. Navigate to the project directory: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
   4. Open the project file:Open your JavaScript file where the NFT code is implemented. You can use any text editor or an IDE like VS Code.
   5. Run the JavaScript code:

You can execute the JavaScript code using Node.js by running the following command in your terminal:
sh

node NFTs.js
Verify the output:

The console should display the details of the minted NFTs and the total supply of NFTs.
1. Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:

        $git clone <link of repo>
        
2. Make sure Node.js is installed.
3. In the project directory, open a terminal and run the code.
